                        In the event you pay for Partner Services using the ScheduleDown Payment Services, your payment will

                        commercial agent on behalf of the relevant Partner, our receipt of the correct payment will
                        discharge your debt to that Partner.

                    receiving Partner Services, if that purchase is handled through the ScheduleDown Payment Services.
                    Additionally, the ScheduleDown Partner may, at their sole discretion, issue a discount that would be
                    reflected on the final tax invoice. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Partner has full responsibility for accounting for indirect taxes on the total value of the ScheduleDown
                    Booking, plus any adjustments for additional goods or services sold or discounts applied, where
                    applicable. ScheduleDown does not charge you taxes on ScheduleDown Bookings, as the Partner Services are
                    provided by the Partner, not by ScheduleDown. As a result, ScheduleDown cannot provide you with a tax invoice
                    in respect of your ScheduleDown Bookings, and tax invoices will need to be provided by the Partner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Payment for all Partner Services must be made at the time of receiving treatment in the currency
                    stated on the Booking Confirmation. You may pay for Partner Services you receive using the
                    ScheduleDown Payment Services, or directly with the Partner with cash or credit card. If you do choose to
                    pay using the ScheduleDown Payment Services, you may be subject to the terms and conditions, privacy
                    policy, and other terms of use of our Payment Processors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Any currency conversion costs or other charges incurred by you in making a payment will be borne
                    by you in addition to the price due to us.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Payments made through the ScheduleDown Payment Services are processed by third party payment
                    services providers (Payment Processors). ScheduleDown takes reasonable care to ensure that the ScheduleDown
                    Payment Services are available and functioning at all times, but cannot guarantee continuous,
                    uninterrupted or secure access to the ScheduleDown Payment Services, nor can we guarantee that the
                    facility is virus or error free. Because the ScheduleDown Payment Services rely on third parties, there are
                    many factors beyond our control (such as delays in the banking system or in card networks), we
                    cannot predict or guarantee the amount of time needed to complete the processing of your payment.
                    Additionally, access to the ScheduleDown Payment Services may be occasionally restricted to allow for
                    repairs, maintenance or the introduction of new facilities or services. We will attempt to provide
                    reasonable notice of any scheduled interruptions to the ScheduleDown Payment Services and will do what
                    we can to restore the facility as soon as reasonably possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                   If you do elect to use the ScheduleDown Payment Services, ScheduleDown will collect the payment in its capacity
                    as the commercial agent of the relevant Partner. Once ScheduleDown has successfully received your
                    payment for the Partner Services, this will discharge your debt to the Partner on whose behalf 
                    ScheduleDown has collected the payment, and the Partner will have no further claim to remuneration from
                    you in connection with that ScheduleDown Booking
                </p>
                <p>
                    For certain ScheduleDown Bookings, there may be an option for you to make a Pay Cash In Store Booking.
                    This means that you may make a ScheduleDown Booking without using the ScheduleDown Payment Services, and
                    then pay the Partner directly for the value of the underlying Partner Services with cash, credit card,
                    or another payment instrument acceptable to the Partner. This option will only appear if the Partner
                    enables this option, and may not appear for some Partners. Please note that when you make a Pay
                    Cash In Store Booking on the ScheduleDown Website or ScheduleDown Widget, no binding legal contract in
                    respect of the ScheduleDown Booking is made.

                    or would have been considered by you and us to be a likely consequence of it at the time we entered
