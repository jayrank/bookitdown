                               You may notice that sometimes, after visiting a website, you see increased numbers of adverts
                                from the site you visited. That’s because the website you visited has placed a cookie on your web

                                piece of code on our websites, called the Facebook Pixel. The information collected, for example
                                which pages you visited, which device you used and what actions you took, will be used in

                                Pixel only lasts for sixty (60) days. Using the Facebook Pixel, we can also remarket adverts to
                                you through Instagram, which is owned by Facebook. You can set preferences for how Facebook
