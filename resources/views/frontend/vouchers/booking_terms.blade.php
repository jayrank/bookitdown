                        like to receive. The Fresha Booking Services provide you with an opportunity to check and amend
                        any errors before confirming your Fresha Booking, and will disclose any other relevant terms (e.g.
                        cancellation policy) to you prior to your confirmation. Please take the time to read and check all

                        on your Fresha Customer Account upon confirming a Fresha Booking. If you require a tax receipt,
                        you need to contact the Partner directly.

                        or 48 hours) determined by the Partner. The interval between when you may reschedule your

                        Partner, and disclosed to you at the time of making your Fresha Booking. You should review and
